# Hospitality Agent Evals: The Aster Room

Forty questions a guest asks a restaurant's AI about wine, the list to answer them from, and a 0 / 1 / 2 rubric for each.

These are the questions I test The House Somm with, the AI sommelier I built, adapted so anyone can run them against any agent. The venue, The Aster Room, is fictional. Every producer, price and policy in it was invented for this set.

**The price checker and the scorer are on GitHub:** ${GITHUB}

## Why it exists

The failures that cost a restaurant money are specific: a wrong price, a bottle that is not on the list, a region instead of a recommendation, a booking the agent cannot make, a sales pitch in reply to a statement. A sommelier notices every one at once. A generic eval notices none of them.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| \`scenarios.jsonl\` | 40 scenarios, 8 categories of 5: the guest's turns, the scoring tier, and the rubric |
| \`categories.jsonl\` | The 8 categories, their tier and rubric |
| \`list.jsonl\` | The priced list, the ground truth for price checks (Canadian dollars) |
| \`venue_knowledge.md\` | The knowledge text the agent under test is given as its system context |

## How to use it

Give your agent \`venue_knowledge.md\` as its context and each scenario's \`turns\` as the conversation. Score its answer to the last guest turn.

Scoring has three tiers. **code**: checked against \`list.jsonl\` by counting and by price matching (the GitHub scorer does this). **rubric**: scored by a person or a model judge you name in your report. **human**: taste, scored by a sommelier, never automated.

One rule outranks the tiers: a wrong price fails the scenario, whatever it was testing. Report the category table, not one number, and report no overall score until every scenario has one.

## Categories

${categoryRows.map((c) => `${c.order}. **${c.name}** (${c.tier})`).join("\n")}

## Limits

One fictional venue, one by-the-glass list, Canadian dollars, English and Chinese, mostly single turns. It does not test voice, real booking systems or a list of hundreds of bottles.
